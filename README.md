## About the Project

*Project Screenshot*

This project is a web-based collage of books I've read. A modal is displayed when a book is clicked on, providing more details about the book - a larger image of the cover, the title, the author(s), and a description.

New books can be added directly on the web interface. A search filter allows for filtering on author and title. Sorting is also available based on date read, author name, and title.
